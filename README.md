# CyberDefense-Toolkit
A curated collection of blue team tools, defensive scripts, and resources for incident response, threat hunting, and security monitoring. Designed to enhance visibility and automate defensive operations.

This repository is structured around the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle (SP 800-61) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). It serves as a knowledge base for the "Blue Team" - the defenders responsible for protecting organizational assets, detecting cyber threats, and responding to incidents. 

Defense lifecycle:

* **Preparation**: Hardening systems and gathering Intelligence.

* **Detection & Analysis**: Monitoring sensors and investigating alerts.

* **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**: Stopping the bleeding and restoring systems.

* **Post-Incident Activity**: Learning from the attack to improve future defense.
